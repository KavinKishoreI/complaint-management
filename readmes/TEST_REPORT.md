## Code Quality Assessment

### Model Classes ✓ GOOD

- **Entities Reviewed:**
  - `Citizen` - Well-structured with proper JPA annotations
  - `Authority` - Correct relationships with Department
  - `Complaint` - Proper status enum and relationships
  - `Response` - Composite key properly implemented with `@EmbeddedId`
  - `Department` - Simple and effective
  - `ComplaintStatus` - Enum with appropriate values

### Controllers ✓ GOOD

- **LoginController:** Proper authentication logic for both user types
- **DashboardController:** Statistics and table view implementation
- **RegisterComplaintController:** Form validation and complaint submission
- **ViewComplaintController:** Complaint details and response display
- **AuthorityDashboardController:** Authority-specific functionality
- **AuthorityRespondController:** Response submission handling

### Database Configuration ✓ EXCELLENT

- Properly externalized configuration using `application.properties`
- Environment variables supported with defaults
- Connection pooling configured
- Hibernate dialect auto-detection enabled

---

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Fixed Issues ✓

1. **Unused Import in ViewComplaintController**

   - **Issue:** `import com.complaintmanagement.model.Authority;` was unused
   - **Fix:** Removed the unused import
   - **Severity:** Minor (warning only)

2. **Unused Import in AuthorityRespondController**

   - **Issue:** `import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;` was unused
   - **Fix:** Removed the unused import
   - **Severity:** Minor (warning only)

3. **Maven Exec Plugin Configuration**
   - **Issue:** Only DatabaseTest was configured as main class
   - **Fix:** Added execution configurations for both DatabaseTest and CompleteSystemTest
   - **Benefit:** Can now run different test classes easily

### Minor Warnings (Not Critical)

1. **Oracle JDBC Background Threads**

   - **Warning:** Oracle JDBC diagnostic threads linger after execution
   - **Impact:** None - this is normal behavior for Oracle JDBC driver
   - **Action:** No fix needed

2. **Hibernate Connection Pool Warning**

   - **Warning:** "Using built-in connection pool (not intended for production use)"
   - **Impact:** None for development/testing
   - **Recommendation:** Use HikariCP or C3P0 for production deployment

3. **Hibernate Dialect Warning**
   - **Warning:** "OracleDialect does not need to be specified explicitly"
   - **Impact:** None - Hibernate auto-detects correctly
   - **Action:** Can optionally remove from application.properties

## Performance Observations

- **Database Connection Time:** < 2 seconds
- **Query Execution Time:** All queries execute in milliseconds
- **Application Startup Time:** ~4 seconds (including Hibernate initialization)

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Notes:**

1. **Passwords are stored in plain text** - For production, implement proper password hashing (BCrypt, Argon2, etc.)
2. **SQL Injection Protection** - Currently using JPA/JPQL which provides protection, but validate all inputs
3. **Database Credentials** - Currently in application.properties; move to environment variables for production
4. **Session Management** - No session timeout implemented; consider adding for production

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. ✅ **Complete** - All critical functionality working
2. ✅ **Complete** - Database schema properly implemented
3. ✅ **Complete** - All relationships working correctly

### Medium Priority (Future Enhancements)

1. **Password Hashing** - Implement BCrypt or similar for password security
2. **Input Validation** - Add comprehensive validation on all forms
3. **Error Handling** - Enhance error messages and user feedback
4. **Logging** - Implement proper logging framework (Log4j2, SLF4J)
5. **Connection Pool** - Replace built-in pool with HikariCP

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Dark Mode** - Already documented, implementation pending
2. **Email Notifications** - Send email when complaint status changes
3. **File Attachments** - Allow citizens to attach images/documents
4. **Advanced Search** - Filter complaints by multiple criteria
5. **Reports** - Generate PDF/Excel reports of complaints
